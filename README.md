# eventspout

Docker vents router that transmits events as they appear to pre-defined HTTP endpint. You can then match event to a host, and container in your app and do some interesting things.

## Status

Unstable, but works.

## Getting eventspout

	$ export DOCKER_HOST="tcp://127.0.0.1:2375"
	$ export SECRET_KEY="secret"
	$ export CALLBACK_URL="http://dev:5000/docker_callback/"
	$ python app.py

## Using eventspout

It is very transparent solution and does not need much configuration besides environment variables.

## Callbacks

Example callback:

	{
		"docker_host": "tcp://127.0.0.1:2375",
		"secret_key": "123",
		"event": {
			"id": "...",
			"status": "die",
			"from": "ubuntu:latest"
		}
	}

You should return "201" as success. Returning any other HTTP code will make `eventspout` transmission retry.
